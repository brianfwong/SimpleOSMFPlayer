To get it to work, I made a merged SDK by starting with the latest Flex from Apache, and merging AIR into it.

Overwriting Flex with AIR anytime they had a conflict.

I used this new SDK, and set Flash player to 16.

The screenshots show how my flash builder 4.7 was configured.


The SDKs can be found here:

My mxml file was based on this discussion (in case it breaks later):
